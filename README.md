# Mental Health and Wellbeing App

## About the Project
This project is a role-based mental health web app designed to support communication and access to care. It provides different dashboards depending on whether the user logs in as a client or staff member. Clients can access features such as email communication, viewing therapy reports, and locating nearby mental health clinics through an integrated map API. Staff members can manage patient records, communicate via email, and access scheduling tools.
The application includes validated user authentication, structured navigation pages (Home, About, Emergency Help), and a clean, accessible user interface.
